# PSF_ALPHA_CHLORIDE
Framework for semi-probabilistic assessment of existing concrete structures, with and without the effect of chloride-induced corrosion.

This respiratory contains the Python files developed in the work of the master thesis "Framework for semi-probabilistic assessment of existing concrete structures, with and without the effect of chloride-induced corrosion." (Sines, 2024) who searches to answer the two research questions:

*  How can fibs assessment methods for existing concrete structures be further improved by
estimating the sensitivity factors?
*  How can reinforced concrete structures degraded by chloride-induced corrosion be evaluated
with a semi-probabilistic approach?

The developed Python programs are tools to perform the assessment with the proposed improvements, and to visualize and evaluate their effects by examples. 

The table below provides an overview of the files and their usage.
